# TASKS Spring Boot App

Small demo of an JPA based API that builds a task list for educational purposes.

run `docker compose up` to start DB and [MyAdmin with admin/changeme](http://localhost:9090) and run `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the app.

Import [Tasks.postman_collection.json](Tasks.postman_collection.json) into Postman to play around and see how tables are created and populated.

Only the tasks endpoints works the rest of entities is there for showcasing purposes.
